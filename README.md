--- Properties (Props) ---

In React, the term props stands for properties, which refers to the properties of an object. This is because all elements created in React are JavaScript objects. As a result, passing data into a component is done by creating properties and values for the object.

Props add a layer of protection to both security and performance. Props work through passing data into a component to be used, typically for UI needs.

className="" is an insanely powerful tool for visual manipulation and spacing
    · flex: Used to set the flexbox layout mode of the element. Flexbox is a CSS layout module that allows you to easily align and distribute items in a container.
